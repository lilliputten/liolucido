# Possible statistical and analytical information (by cursor)

Based on the database schema and the workout system, here's a comprehensive analysis of all statistical and analytical information that could be provided to users:

## Individual Workout Analysis

### Current Workout Progress

- Completion Percentage: `(stepIndex / questionsCount) * 100`
- Time Elapsed: `currentTime` (if available) or `(now - startedAt)`
- Current Accuracy: `(correctAnswers / stepIndex) * 100` (for completed questions)
- Remaining Questions: `questionsCount - stepIndex`
- Estimated Time to Complete: Based on average time per question

### Workout Session Statistics

- Total Time Spent: `finishedAt - startedAt`
- Average Time per Question: `totalTime / questionsCount`
- Accuracy Rate: `(correctAnswers / totalQuestions) * 100`
- Question Difficulty Analysis: Time spent per question vs. correctness
- Learning Curve: Accuracy improvement over time within session

## Historical Performance Analysis

### Topic-Specific Statistics

- Total Workouts Completed: Count of `WorkoutStats` records
- Average Accuracy: `AVG(ratio)` across all workouts
- Best Performance: `MAX(ratio)` and associated details
- Worst Performance: `MIN(ratio)` and associated details
- Average Time per Workout: `AVG(timeSeconds)`
- Fastest Completion: `MIN(timeSeconds)`
- Slowest Completion: `MAX(timeSeconds)`

### Progress Over Time

- Accuracy Trend: Line chart showing `ratio` over time
- Speed Trend: Line chart showing `timeSeconds` over time
- Learning Velocity: Rate of improvement in accuracy
- Consistency Score: Standard deviation of accuracy scores
- Streak Analysis: Consecutive high/low performance periods

### Question-Level Analytics
