Migrate data interchage methods to react query
26-react-query
2025.08.26

- Added zod schemas.
- Replaced all `*Context` via `Available*(s)` hooks.
- Migrated all data fetch invocations to react-query hooks.
- Returned all `*ScopeBreadcrumbs` to `*Breadcrumbs`.

---

- Added api response wrapper, with tests.
- Added sample api wrapper usage snippet, injected api wrapper on WorkoutQuestionContainer component, improved api wrapper errors processing. Added debouncing of api messages.
- Added `invalidateReactQueryKeys` handler to invalidate react query keys, in the future.
- IN PROGRESS: apiWrapper migration stage 1: Server & client parts migrated to a new scheme.
- Added some missed TApiResponse usage cases.
- Rolled back TApiResponse approach form server side action functions.
- Remove usage of `TApiResponse` data from the server action functions and leave it only in api routes. Created missed coresponding api routes (with `TApiResponse` usage) and replaced all invocations of these functions by fetching of data from these api routes. Added workaround for date functions to allow processing of ISO date strings instead of date objects (api routes return ISO strings, server functions provide date objects from prisma).
- Added react query.
- Used `useInvalidateReactQueryKeys` hook to obtain react query invalidate callback.
- Prepared to use react query in `AvailableTopicsListWrapper` (using `api/topics` route (which implements call to the `src/features/topics/actions/getAvailableTopics` server function).
- Added react query's `useInfiniteQuery` to the available topics page and it's subcomponents.
- Added react query hook `useAnswers` to the `WorkoutQuestionContainer`. Fixed tests. Updated usage of `QueryKey` in the invalidation hooks.
- Minor changes.
- Updated `getAvailableTopics` server function to be a universal one for getting topics data (added `topicIds`, `includeSortWorkouts`, `adminMode` parameters, added tests). Using `ExtendedUser` instead `TExtendedUser`, when possible (to check).
- Updated `getAvailableTopics` tests: it's impossible to sort by multiple relation -- previous `includeSortWorkouts` is removed. Added test for `includeWorkout` parameter.
- Added zustand store of `ManageTopicsStore`, extracted `ScrollAreaInfinite` component for support paginated data loading (eg, via react query `useInfiniteQuery`). Added the `ManageTopicsStore` to the `ManageTopicsListWrapper` component and it's descendants.
- Partially replaced `useTopicsContext` with `useAvailableTopicsByScope` in ManageTopicsList\* components (in progress). Upgraded `useAvailableTopics` hook. Updated typings for `getAvailableTopics` (via zod/typescript), see `TTopic.ts` and `getAvailableTopicsSchema.ts`). Extracted reused `ScrollAreaInfinite` component to allow incremental paginated scroll (ready to integrate with react query `useInfiniteQuery` hook). Updated urls composing logic (it's allowed to create them part-by-part, from multiple chunks).
- Updated `useAvailableTopics` logic: used cached callbacks (returned from the custom hook) instead of independent functions, extracted helpers, updated router hooks, finished `AddTopicModal`.
- Replaced topics context in DeleteTopicModal. Updated modals opening logic in `ManageTopicsPageModalsWrapper`.
- Finished replacing topics context in all the components. Completely removed basic `TopicsContext` module (`TopicsContextDefinitions` still remained).
- (IN PROGRESS) Added react query hook `useAvailableTopicById` for load available topic, possibly cached in the `useAvailableTopicsByScope`.
- (IN PROGRESS) Updated react query hook `useAvailableTopicById`, added server funciton `getAvailableTopicById`, which accepts parameters for customizable prisma result (to include different data, like questions count, workout, user).
- Added corresponding api route for getting available topic data. Extracted (some) zod schemes (to the `src/lib/zod-schemes` folder). Fixed wrong loading skeleton displaying in the `ViewTopicCard` component. Implemented fetching of the topic data in the `ViewAnswerContentSummary` component via `useAvailableTopicById` smart hook (linked to `useAvailableTopicsByScope` to use cached topics data). Fixed get topics api route (added missed `includeWorkout` parameter). Added get topic data api route parameterized method (uses `getAvailableTopicById` server function). Removed some redundant usages of allTopics data (to extra check if the specified topic record exists or not): in select language page, as example.
- Replaced fetching of current topic data from cached topics by `useAvailableTopicById` react-query hook.
- Refactored hook imports.
- Refactored TGetAvailableTopicsResults: using common `items` instead of more specific `topics` (to create shared helpers and generic types).
- IN PROGRESS: Added basic types and core server function for "get available questions" hooks support.
- Finished core server functions for "get available questions/question" hooks support.
- Partially replace questions context with `useAvailableQuestions` and `useAvailableQuestionById`. Added infinite scroll on the `ManageTopicQuestionsListCard`.
- Created scope breadcrumbs for questions and answers.
- Partially replaced questions context on: ViewQuestionCard, AddQuestionModal.
- Partially replaced questions context on DeleteQuestionModal.
- Partially replaced questions context on EditQuestionCard, updated events processing on the DeleteQuestionModal, fixed `updateQuestion` server function.
- Fully replaced questions context on EditQuestionCard, updated events processing on the DeleteQuestionModal, fixed `updateQuestion` server function. Removed (commented out) unused bradcrumbs' components and helpers.
- Removed questions context from everywhere. Added options to fetch embedded questions (for topics) and answers (for questions) Available requests.
- Renamed `zod-schemes` -> `zod-schemas`.
- Added basic types and server functions for AvaialbleAnswer(s) interface.
- Added `useAvailableAnswers` and `useAvailableAnswerById` react-query hooks.
- Added AvailableAnswer(s) on the `ManageTopicQuestionAnswersListCard` page and its subcomponents. Removed unused code from `TopicsBreadcrumbs` and `QuestionsBreadcrumbs`. Updated button styles. Updated queryKey's for `useAvailableAnswers` and `useAvailableQuestions` (include crsp parent entity id: `questionId` and `topicId` respectively).
- Replaced AnswersContext via AvailableAnswer(s) in the `AddAnswerModal` and `DeleteAnswerModal`.
- Extracted workout server actions from routes, fixed prisma scheme to really auto update `updatedAt` fields (updated some server functions to not override db values).
- Replaced AnswersContext via AvailableAnswer(s) in the `ManageTopicQuestionAnswers` component, updated question and answer edit forms and cards.
- Replaced AnswersContext via AvailableAnswer(s) in the all remained components. (`ManageTopicQuestionAnswers` subcomponents).

## Work, queries and todos

### Refactoring process

```javascript

useAnswersContext -> useAvailableAnswers, useAvailableAnswerById
AnswersBreadcrumbs -> AnswersScopeBreadcrumbs

useQuestionsContext -> useAvailableQuestions, useAvailableQuestionById
QuestionsBreadcrumbs -> QuestionsScopeBreadcrumbs

useTopicsContext -> useAvailableTopicsByScope (-> useAvailableTopics), useAvailableTopicById
TopicsBreadcrumbs -> TopicsScopeBreadcrumbs

// Paths

const { manageScope } = useManageTopicsStore();

// Calculate paths...
const topicsListRoutePath = `/topics/${manageScope}`;
const topicRoutePath = `${topicsListRoutePath}/${topicId}`;
const questionsListRoutePath = `${topicRoutePath}/questions`;
const questionRoutePath = `${questionsListRoutePath}/${questionId}`;
const answersListRoutePath = `${questionRoutePath}/answers`;
const answerRoutePath = `${answersListRoutePath}/${answerId}`;

questionsContext.routePath -> questionsListRoutePath

```

### Queries

Ok, Let's try to replace all direct calls to server functions and client fetch

Don't forget to add eslint comments and debugger stoppers for all console.error call occurencies:

```
// eslint-disable-next-line no-console
console.error(...)
debugger; // eslint-disable-line no-debugger
```

Use the `src/app/api/questions/[questionId]/answers/route.ts` and `src/components/pages/AvailableTopics/WorkoutQuestion/WorkoutQuestionContainer.tsx` as examples of server- and client-side implementations.

Here is a draf list of server side routes and functions, what require update:

- src/app/api/questions/[questionId]/answers/route.ts (already done)
- src/app/api/questions/[questionId]/route.ts
- src/app/api/settings/route.ts
- src/app/api/workouts/route.ts
- src/app/api/workouts/[topicId]/route.ts
- src/features/answers/actions/addNewAnswer.ts
- src/features/answers/actions/deleteAnswer.ts
- src/features/answers/actions/getQuestionAnswers.ts
- src/features/answers/actions/updateAnswer.ts
- src/features/questions/actions/addNewQuestion.ts
- src/features/questions/actions/deleteQuestion.ts
- src/features/questions/actions/getQuestion.ts
- src/features/questions/actions/getTopicQuestions.ts
- src/features/questions/actions/updateQuestion.ts
- src/features/settings/actions/getSettings.ts
- src/features/settings/actions/updateSettings.ts
- src/features/topics/actions/addNewTopic.ts
- src/features/topics/actions/checkIfTopicExists.ts
- src/features/topics/actions/deleteTopic.ts
- src/features/topics/actions/getAllUsersTopics.ts
- src/features/topics/actions/getAvailableTopics.ts
- src/features/topics/actions/getThisUserTopics.ts
- src/features/topics/actions/getTopic.ts
- src/features/topics/actions/updateTopic.ts
- src/features/users/actions/checkIfUserExists.ts
- src/features/users/actions/createUserOrUpdateTelegramUser.ts
- src/features/users/actions/deleteUser.ts
- src/features/users/actions/getUserByEmail.ts
- src/features/users/actions/getUserById.ts
- src/features/users/actions/getUsersByIdsList.ts

Can you find all the calls to these api methods on the client side on your own, or do you need help?

Corrections:

Some fixes for server parts:

- Use `src/app/api/questions/[questionId]/answers/route.ts` as a template for server side parts:

- Please don't use `duration` properties for messages: I've already got rid of it (it's not necessary).

- Just make short commented placeholders for `invalidateKeys` and `messages`.

All other things in server parts look ok (later we'll pass it through linters).

Client parts:

- Use answers retrieving fragment `src/components/pages/AvailableTopics/WorkoutQuestion/WorkoutQuestionContainer.tsx` as a template.

- Use `onInvalidateKeys: invalidateReactQueryKeys` instead inline functions for `onInvalidateKeys` options fields (I'll integrate it with react query later). There already is implementation of `invalidateReactQueryKeys` in the `src/lib/data/invalidateReactQueryKeys.ts` (available to import as `import { invalidateReactQueryKeys } from '@/lib/data';`).

- Add `debugDetails` option parameter to simplify the debugging process. It should be an object like `debugDetails: { initiator: 'WorkoutQuestionContainer', url },` -- it contains a reference on a distinctive initiator component/module/path and other available parameters (an `url` in this case).

- In the `catch` section fetch ad disaplay in `console.error` the `APIError` details property (`const details = error instanceof APIError ? error.details : null;`).

- Display a toast error message in case of error, if there no this call yet.

Generic recomendations:

- Don't add duplicated imports.

- Keep also in mind that you have to import types from '@shared', like `import { APIError } from '@/lib/types/api';`.

---

Check these modules for the usage of `handleServerAction`:

- src/components/modals/DeleteAccountModal.tsx
- src/hooks/useWorkout.ts

And check corresponding server-side api routes for creating correct `TApiResponse` data.

NextResponse.json:

I'm sorry, let's roolback some changes.

Let's completely remove usage of `TApiResponse` data from the server action functions and leave it only in api routes.

So, the 1st step is: we have to rollback `TApiResponse` from the following server functions (actions):

- addNewAnswer: src/features/answers/actions/addNewAnswer.ts
- deleteAnswer: src/features/answers/actions/deleteAnswer.ts
- getQuestionAnswers: src/features/answers/actions/getQuestionAnswers.ts
- updateAnswer: src/features/answers/actions/updateAnswer.ts
- getTopicQuestions: src/features/questions/actions/getTopicQuestions.ts
- updateQuestion: src/features/questions/actions/updateQuestion.ts
- updateSettings: src/features/settings/actions/updateSettings.ts
- getAvailableTopics: src/features/topics/actions/getAvailableTopics.ts
- getThisUserTopics: src/features/topics/actions/getThisUserTopics.ts
- getTopic: src/features/topics/actions/getTopic.ts
- updateTopic: src/features/topics/actions/updateTopic.ts

And, wherever they are used, let's create coresponding api routes (with `TApiResponse` usage) and reaplace all invocations of these functions by fetching of data from these api routes.

So, the 2nd step is: For the following client side components replace calls of the specified server functions with newly created api routes (with the corresponding paths, respectively).

Ask me about specific route paths in case of troubles (if it isn't obsvious).

- src/components/pages/ManageTopicQuestionAnswers/AddAnswerModal/AddAnswerModal.tsx: addNewAnswer
- src/components/pages/ManageTopicQuestionAnswers/DeleteAnswerModal/DeleteAnswerModal.tsx: deleteAnswer
- src/components/pages/ManageTopicQuestionAnswers/EditAnswerCard/EditAnswerForm.tsx: updateAnswer
- src/components/pages/ManageTopicQuestions/EditQuestionCard/EditQuestionForm.tsx: updateQuestion
- src/components/pages/ManageTopicsPage/EditTopicCard/EditTopicForm.tsx: updateTopic
- src/contexts/SettingsContext/SettingsContext.tsx: updateSettings (wrap with `handleApiResponse`)

Can you suggest an approach to integrate react query to the available topics list?

See the module `src/components/pages/AvailableTopics/AvailableTopicsListWrapper.tsx` and it's descendants.

Don't apply any changes at first, let approve the general approach.

---

There's already a general purpose api route to fetch available topics: `src/app/api/topics/route.ts` it could be parametrized later.

And it already supports `skip` and `take` parameters to support incremental data loading (which is used currently). So, we can use `useInfiniteQuery` hook.

Let's try to implement this.

---

Don't use axios. Use fetch.

Take a look at the example of api fetchng in the src/components/pages/ManageTopicQuestions/ManageTopicQuestionsListCard.tsx, please use this scheme.

Pay attention to usage of handleApiResponse to process api requests. Notify onInvalidateKeys to pass an invalidation hook (you have to get this hook via useInvalidateReactQueryKeys if it's absent), debugDetails to provide debug information, catch section with error logging, debug stop (add eslint warning stopper comments) and error toast.

Don't forget also to add typescropt types where they are missed.

---

Help to solve the bug:

The client (from useAvailableTopics) calls api route via /api/topics?skip=0&take=10, but the src/app/api/topics/route.ts gets nothing in params parameter (and the same is in the searchParams).

How can I correctly get url quesry params in nextjs route?

How to sort by related object's field in Prisma?

I have the following schema:

```prisma
model User {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String?
  topics Topic[]
  userTopicWorkout UserTopicWorkout[]
  @@map("users")
}

model Topic {
  id String @id @default(cuid())
  name String
  userTopicWorkout UserTopicWorkout[]
  @@index([userId])
  @@map("topics")
}

model UserTopicWorkout {
  userId String @map("user_id")
  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  topicId String @map("topic_id")
  topic   Topic  @relation(fields: [topicId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("updated_at")
  @@id([userId, topicId])
  @@map("user_topic_workouts")
}
```

Each user and each topic has a list of `userTopicWorkout`. But each `userTopicWorkout` for the user and the topic (so, the user has only one `userTopicWorkout` per a topic).

And I want to sort topics by the related `userTopicWorkout` object's `updatedAt` date for the given user.

I've tried to achieve that by the following command:

```ts
const topics = await jestPrisma.topic.findMany({
  where: { userId: user.id, id: { in: topicIds } },
  include: {
    userTopicWorkout: {
      select: {
        updatedAt: true,
      },
    },
  },
  orderBy: { userTopicWorkout: { updatedAt: 'desc' } },
});
```

But I'm getting the following typescript error:

```
Type '{ userTopicWorkout: { updatedAt: string; }; }' is not assignable to type 'TopicOrderByWithRelationInput | TopicOrderByWithRelationInput[] | undefined'.
  Types of property 'userTopicWorkout' are incompatible.
    Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'updatedAt' does not exist in type 'UserTopicWorkoutOrderByRelationAggregateInput'.ts(2322)
```

How can I achieve the goal and sort topics by related `userTopicWorkout`?

-->

The only solution is to fetch `prisma.userTopicWorkout`:

```javascript
const userTopicWorkouts = await prisma.userTopicWorkout.findMany({
  where: {
    userId: user.id,
    topicId: { in: topicIds },
  },
  orderBy: {
    updatedAt: 'desc',
  },
  include: {
    topic: true,
  },
});
const topicsSortedByUpdatedAt = userTopicWorkouts.map((utw) => utw.topic);
```
